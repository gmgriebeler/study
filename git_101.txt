GIT CLONING, COMMITING AND PUSHING 101

A) Clone repository locally:
    1) Locate (cd ~/source) or create folder to keep repositories:
        mkdir -p ~/source
        cd ~/source
    2) Clone repository
        - On repo's GH page --> click Code --> SSH --> copy the link
        - In GitBash --> git clone git@github.com:username/<repo-name>.git

B) Enter the cloned repo:
    cd myproject    # Goes to the cloned repo
    
    git remote -v   # check the connection

C) Stage (add) a file to git tracking (tells Git you want it included in the next commit)
    git add example.txt
    git add .       #adds all changes
    git status      #checks what is staged

D) Commit changes with a message:
    git commit -m "Add example.txt with initial content"

E) Push changes to GitHub:
    git push origin main

    E.1) Push to a new branch for the first time:
        git push -u origin branch    

F) Create a new branch:
    git branch test

    F.1) Create a new branch and switch to it
        git checkout -b test

OBS: 1- Always merge being on main branch
     2- GitLens Extension on VSCode helps with visualization and git management
